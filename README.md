# Project Overview

The Agile Board project is a Kanban Task Management App that allows users to manage tasks, switch from dark mode to light mode, add and delete tasks, and edits task status from todo, doing and done.

# Features

The Agile Board project includes a variety of functionalities:

# Task Interaction and Detail Management

The Agile Board project is a task management app that allows users to manage tasks and customize the app's appearance. With this app, users can click on an individual task to view its details and make updates to the task title, description, and status. Users can also save changes, delete tasks, and cancel edits without saving. The app makes it easy to navigate between task statuses and view task details.

Additionally, the app includes a "Delete Task" button that updates the user interface when a task is deleted. Users can customize the app's theme by switching to dark mode or light mode and showing or hiding the sidebar. The app also allows users to add new tasks by clicking "Add New Task" and adding a title, description, and status. New tasks appear in the user interface under the correct status, and users can view and edit new task details. The app saves new tasks in local storage, reflects task updates in local storage, and removes deleted tasks from local storage. To get started, users can clone the provided starter code repository, open the project in their code editor, and code their solution to the user stories. It's important to clear the local storage as they are building the project to ensure tasks are loading correctly.

# Learning Reflections

As I worked on the Agile Board project, I learned how to manage my time effectively, break down complex tasks into smaller components, and prioritize my work to meet project deadlines.

Throughout the project, I faced several challenges, debugging code, implementing features, and particularly DOM elements as i was unsure to use all of the elements. However, I was able to overcome these challenges by seeking help from my peers and testing my code thoroughly.

Overall, the Agile Board project was a valgood learning experience that allowed me to apply my technical skills and develop new ones. Im looking forward to continuing to learn and grow as a javascript developer
